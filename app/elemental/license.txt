What is Creative Commons?

Creative Commons is a non-profit organization that, among many other things, creates and maintains a number of different licenses under which designers, coders, writers and other content creators can freely release their work.

What is the Creative Commons Attribution License, and how does it apply to your free templates?

The Creative Commons Attribution license is one of those licenses, and it's the one we use for all of our templates. This means you can download them and ...

	Use them for personal projects.

	Use them commercially.

	Modify them however you want.

	Port them to content management systems, blog platforms, or whatever else. (* see note below)


... all for free (and royalty free). All you have to do is credit us and you're good to go.

That's great! So how do I credit you?

Just visibly credit or link to us somewhere on the site using the template. All of our templates already come with a footer credit (which is enough to satisfy the crediting requirement), but if you need to move it somewhere else feel free to do so.

* How does the license apply to ports/derivative works?

Like the templates themselves, any ports/derivative works have to be released under a Creative Commons Attribution license as well. They also have to visibly credit us in some way.
